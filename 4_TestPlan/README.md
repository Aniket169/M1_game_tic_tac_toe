Introduction
This plan specifies the tests that Software Architects intends to execute to investigate the correctness of the TicTacToe application. 
The application is distributed and consists of four major threads of activity executing on as many as four different platforms.

Test Items
The three major processes that comprise the application are the major test items. 

Tested Features
All of the current features of the application will be tested. In addition, the APIs of the major classes will also be tested.

Description of Functionality
At the system level, the functionality is an electronic version of the TicTacToe game.

Arguments for tests
Mouse clicks

Expected Output
It is expected that the appropriate symbol will appear in the selected slot on both GameBoards.
When the game completes in either the win/lost or tied states the appropriate message is printed on the GameBoard.


Test Case Success/Failure Criteria
At the system test level, test cases result in one of three terminal states for the game: exited, won/lost and tied.

Pass/Fail Criteria for the Complete Test Cycle
Every primary use case must be successful for the application to pass. If any test associated with a primary use case fails, 
the system test fails.

Problem Determination and Correction Responsibilities
The tester is responsible for completing a test report that identifies those tests that have resulted in program failure. 
The developer is responsible for addressing each deficiency identified in the test report.
